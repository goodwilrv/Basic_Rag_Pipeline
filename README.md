# Basic_Rag_Pipeline
This pipeline is inspired from deeplearning.ai RAG certification course.

Here I have used my cover letter to make the model learn context about my cover letter for the job search.

This repository contains a project which shows building a basic RAG pipeline with ingestion, Retrieval and Synthesis. 
Here i use one of my cover letter which i used for my job applications. This contains an evaluation file as well which
has some questions related to my cover letter. We run this evaluation for BASIC RAG, Sentence window retrieval and auto merging retrieval
techniques. We get the values for groundedness, context relevance and response relevance parameters for the questions.
